# Self Solving Battleship :anchor:

This was a projec I made after finishing my first programming class, intro to Java. It is a simple app that runs in your terminal, creates a  battleship game, then the computer chooses one space at a time, until there are no more ships on the field, then the program stops and tells you how long it took to win the game.

This project was made entirely in Java (:coffee:).
